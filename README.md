## Directed Weighted Graph

This is project focuses on creating directional weighted graphs and using efficient algorithms in order to find the shortest distance and paths between any two given nodes. we can also find the strongly connected components of the graph using our functions. 


## Algorithems in project
In this project two main algorithms are used. One is the Dijkstra's algorithm and the other is the Breadth-first search Algorithm. Dijkstra's Algorithm was used in order to find the shortest path between any two given nodes. Breadth-first Search was used in order to find the strongly connected component and components

## Data Structures
This project is built on three main layers:
*NodeData - represents a node
*DiGraph - represents a weighted graph
*GraphAlgo - algorithms being used on the Directed weighted graph
